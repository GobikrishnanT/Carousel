# Carousel

# FIRST VERY THANKS FOR SEEING MY PROJECT ----->

# This is Carousel !!!!!!!!!
# In this project i have used the logic that is my own idea and it working spr fine!!!
# The logic that i was used in this is project is easy to understand by everyone , beginner too!
# And i learned about the animation part and box showdow property more depth.

# Animation that i have used coz when changing image animation will help us to attract the user!
# animation : fade (animation name) 2s(animation-time) ease in(picture will sperad inside slowly)


# box shadow :
# box-shadow:  0px 8px 4px rgb(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.2) ,
#                 8px 0px 4px rgb(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.2) , 
#                 0px -8px 4px rgb(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.2) ,
#                 -8px 0px 4px rgb(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.2) ;

# this box shadow will reflect on four sides of the image and rgb is used here to decrease the opacity of the colour that we used!
